Scowl "Cameron Young, you are hereby forbidden from participating in the school tournament!"

#(shocked)
Cameron "But-!"

#(stoic)
Scowl "End of discussion. I'll contact you at a late date regarding your previous tournament winnings, including possible confiscations."

#(sad)
Cameron "That's fine. You can take away all of my medals and trophies if you want."

Cameron "I just wanted to be an inspiration to other girls - to prove that gender does not always have to be an obstacle for whatever they want to achieve..."

Scowl "That's absurd. A woman could never possibly hope to compete among the men."

#(Robin appears serious.)

Robin "If you're so sure about that, why don't you let her compete and see for yourself?!"

#(realizes)
Cameron "Robin!"

#(shocked)
Scowl "You knew about this?"

Robin "Do you have any idea how hard she worked to get to where she is now?! You can't hide the fact that she was able to win tournaments against guys!"

Robin "You haven't seen how she can beat everyone here!"

#(serious)
Scowl "Maybe that just reflects how weak you and your team are. But, I've also heard about you, Robin Liyun."

#(grins)
Scowl "Since you've given up sculling on gondolas, you decided to take up martial arts instead? You even tried to give up during one of your matches."

Scowl "Is that all you know how to do?"

Robin "Leave my personal life out of this!"

#(stoic)
Scowl "If you keep this up, I'll disqualify the entire team, and the school won't be able to compete ever again."

#(shocked)
Robin "What?!"

#(sad)
Cameron "Robin, stop! I can't let everyone else pay the consequences for something I did..."

#(serious)
Robin "Are you going to give up on your goal now?! Just because someone said you couldn't?!"

Robin "If he really thinks you don't stand a chance against a guy, why is he so strict about not letting you compete?!"

#(grins)
Scowl "Tell you what. Since you're so persistent about participating in the tournament, I'll cut you a deal."

Scowl "If your team takes first place, I'll grant you special permission to enter men's tournaments. I'll even donate funds for your team's facility."

#(stoic)
Scowl "But, if you fail, all of your past awards will be stripped and you will be banned from all martial arts tournaments in the future."

#(serious)
Cameron "I accept! I don't have any intentions of turning back here!"

Scowl "Try your best not to disappoint me."

#EXT. School Entrance - Day

#(Play quality time music. Robin and Cameron are present. Cameron looks embarrassed.)

Cameron "Thanks for standing up for me back there. I don't know what I could've done without you..."

Robin "You're giving me too much credit. If you weren't any good, I'm sure Mr. Scowl wouldn't have reconsidered."

Robin "It's all thanks to your hard work that you've been given another opportunity."

#(normal)
Cameron "I was planning on revealing my secret after winning anyway. I can't inspire anyone if they all still think I'm a guy."

#(curious)
Robin "You've won several tournaments in the past, haven't you? Why now?"

Cameron "People might think it's a fluke if I only won one. I felt the best way to convince everyone was to show consistent results."

#(normal)
Robin "You always go the extra mile for everything, don't you?"

#(sad)
Cameron "If you're not giving it 110 percent, you'll never know what you're capable of. I've met so many people who've failed to reach their goals because they didn't try hard enough."

Cameron "And, for the longest time, I thought you were one of them. By working towards my own goal, I wanted to inspire you that it's possible to find success, no matter who you are or what others think."

#(normal)
Cameron "Hopefully, my message reaches someone out there..."

#(serious)
Robin "Let me join the team. Just for the tournament."

#(surprised)
Cameron "H-Huh?!"

#(normal)
Robin "I want to support you somehow. Even if I end up benched most of the time, I want to be there with you every step of the way, just like how you've always been supporting me."

#(embarrassed)
Cameron "When you put it like that, I can't refuse..."

#(smiles)
Robin "I'd be upset if you did. Anyway, I need to hurry to work now, so I'll see you later!"

#(realizes)
Cameron "Robin!"

Robin "Hm?"

"Teams from various schools have gathered the following weekend as they wait for the brackets to be announced. Meanwhile, Cameron is in the middle of giving her team a pep talk."

#(Cameron, Cho, and Larry are present. They all look serious and are wearing their uniforms.)

Cameron "Today is the day we've been waiting for! The day when we can proudly stand among the other schools!"

Cameron "It is our duty to represent our school to the best of our abilities, so I expect no less than your very best! IS THAT CLEAR?!"

Everyone "YES, SIR!!!"

Cameron "Today, I want to prove that with enough practice, hard work, and determination, anyone can achieve their goals regardless of who they are or what they are striving for!"

Cameron "Some of us never had any passion for the martial arts, but I've witnessed your growth over the past couple of months, and I am proud of every one of you."

Larry "So can I quit the team if we win?"

#(grins)
Cameron "But, this isn't about me. This...is about us! We are a team!"

Cameron "Whatever our result may be, I would like to thank you all for your hard work. Whether you are in the match or benched, none of this would be possible without your support."

Cameron "We will overcome every obstacle in our way! Let's take home the trophy!"

Larry "WHO ARE WE???!!!"

Everyone "AQUA!!!"

Larry "WHAT DO WE WANT??!!"

Everyone "THAT HOT REDHEAD!!!"

Cho "IN THE NAME OF DIANA, THIS TEAM SHALL BE VICTORIOUS!!!! MEN, PREPARE FOR BLOODSHED!!!"

Everyone "YYEEEAAAAAHHHH!!!!"

#(Hide all characters.)

"Meanwhile, Cameron is off to the side staring at her team with disgust. It almost looks like she's trying to disassociate herself from them."

#(Cameron appears with a nervous smile.)

Cameron "Those simple-minded blockheads... I don't know if I'm more amazed or annoyed, but they seem more pumped now than during my speech."

#(normal)
Cameron "At least they're motivated. Maybe Diana is cut out to be a cheerleader after all."

#(Hide the characters.)

"More spectators begin to fill the bleachers, while several guys came down to take pictures of the cheerleaders. But, once enough people settled down, Mr. Scowl walks to the center of the gym with a mic in his hand."

#(Mr. Scowl appears stoic.)

Scowl "People are not born equal. Whether it's our race, gender, class, or even disabilities, our fates are decided the moment we enter the world."

Scowl "Equality is nothing but an illusion, and competitions like these are no different. Every round will divide the strong from the weak, but which one are you?"

#(serious)
Scowl "Only the strong will emerge victorious in the end, while the rest of you will leave empty-handed! May the tournament begin!"

#(Mr. Scowl leaves.)

"Fighters glare at their opponents with an air of intimidation, especially Aqua High. Driven by the power of lust, their members almost seem prepared to kill if necessary."

#(Play motivation music. Cameron appears with a serious face.)

"When the referees ordered each team to summon their competitors, Cameron is the first to step forward."

#(off screen)
May "Cameron is going up first? Wouldn't it make more sense to save the captain for later?"

#(off screen)
Diana "Guess that just goes to show confident they are. You'll never make it if ya rely on one person alone, am I right?"

#(nervous smile)
Cameron "(Having the other members go first would've been the smarter decision, but the team insisted that I go instead. Apparently, they want to sweep their way to victory...)"

#(normal)
Cameron "(But, this isn't bad either. As the captain, I will set the stage for my team by earning that first point.)"

May "Fight, Cameron! Fight!"

Diana "Let's go, Cam! Ya got this!"

"As her opponent steps forward, Cameron prepares herself for battle. The referee checks with both sides to confirm that they are ready."

#(End motivation music.)

#(off screen)
Referee "BEGIN!"

#(Play battle music. Same CG of Cameron fighting.)

"Without further ado, the match commences, but neither side has made a move. They're pacing themselves and getting a feel for each other's footwork."

"Both fighters are patiently waiting to see who will strike first. But, the second Cameron notices a slight pause in his footing, she advances forward."

"Careful not to overextend, she applies more pressure through movement than attacking. By doing so, her opponent is caught off balance and finds himself in a vulnerable position."

"Just as her opponent starts falling, he anchors his palm against the mat while executing a surprising leg sweep. The sudden switch from defense to offense catches Cameron off guard."

"However, the motion was just long enough for Cameron to react in time, allowing her to evade with a short hop before transitioning into her own counter."

"As her opponent scurries to turn around, Cameron lands quick enough to extend her leg. With nowhere to go, his eyes widen."

Cameron "HYAAHHHHH!!!!!"

#(Screen shakes.)

"A brutal axe kick drops over his shoulder like a guillotine, knocking him out with a single blow. The referee checks on him and confirms that he cannot continue."

Cho "Of course! As expected of such worthy adversaries!"

#(Cameron leaves. Cho looks serious.)

"As Cameron leaves the ring, she is met with cheers from her fellow teammates. Despite their ulterior motives, the sight of them all huddling together could convince anyone that they were a legitimate team."

"Meanwhile, Cho meets his opponent who is around the same height as himself. The two fighters bow to each other before readying their stances."

#(End motivation music.)

#(off screen)
Referee "BEGIN!"

#(Play battle music. Hide Cho.)

"Once the referee stepped back, Cho is immediately on the offensive and he grips his opponent's hands while applying his upper body strength."

"But, pressuring his foe proved to be more difficult than he expected. Not only did they match each other in height, they're also about equal in terms of power."

"The fight switched to more of a wrestling match as both sides are attempting to grip around each other's necks."

"With just enough room to move, Cho barely squeezes in a sharp knee through the other fighter's gut, knocking the wind out of him. With that, the neutral situation switches back to Cho's advantage."

"Agonizing in pain, the other fighter wraps his arms around his stomach, leaving his guard wide open. Cho smirks as he tightens his fist."

#(Cho appears serious.)

Cho "Dragon.....PUUUUNNNNCH!!!!"

#(Hide Cho. Screen shakes.)

"Reminiscent to classic fighting games, Cho lands a clean uppercut through his opponent's jaw, sending him flying across the ring. The referee hurries over to the other side and finds the fighter unconscious."

Cho "Of course! Only the captain is a match for The Dragon!"

Diana "Attaboy! Keep punchin' your way to the top!"

#(Cho leaves. Diana's expression returns to normal.)

"As Cho leaves to reunite with his teammates, Larry steps forward, eager to follow the win streak."

Diana "Yep! I'm rootin' for ya!"

Larry "Heheheh. You'll be crawling for me after I'm done here."

Larry "Hurry up! Which one of you pussies is next?!"

#(End motivation music.)

"The opposing team glares at him in response to his insult, while Cameron turns away and shakes her head with disapproval."

#(laughs)
Larry "What's wrong?! Afraid I'll whoop your sorry butts?!"

#(Larry looks shocked.)

"As a towering figure walks towards him, the smirk on his face begins to fade. His cocky attitude became nothing but fear and regret."

"Larry's opponent, who is twice his size, literally overshadows his presence. People even started betting money on him, as the outcome of this battle is painfully clear."

Referee "Do you wish to concede?"

Larry "WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED YET!!!"

#(off screen)
Referee "BEGIN!"

#(Play battle music. Larry looks serious.)

"Larry takes a few steps back, while the other fighter doesn't move an inch. But, as Larry gets a better look at his foe from a distance, some of his confidence seems to return."

#(grins)
Larry "I've fought people stronger than you! You're nothing compared to them!"

#(off screen)
Cameron "(But, you haven't even fought him yet...)"

"The other fighter doesn't say a word, but he seems amused by how hard Larry is trying to bluff. Larry doesn't pay him any attention and keeps going."

#(serious)
Larry "Well, you know what they say. THE BIGGER THEY ARE, THE HARDER THEY FALL!!!"

#(Hide Larry.)

"Larry opts for the frontal assault and immediately takes off sprinting. But even then, the other fighter doesn't take a stance."

"Attempting to fool his opponent with the direct approach, Larry dives in for a sudden leg sweep instead."

Larry "Heh. Gotcha!"

#(Screen shakes. Cracking sound effect.)

#(off screen)
Larry "GAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!"

"Both parties are left speechless by what they were witnessing. The other fighter simply lifted his foot to avoid the sweep and stomped on Larry like the bug he is."

"Larry struggles to free himself from the obstacle, but the more he tried to wiggle himself out, the tighter it became."

Larry "Ugh! But how?! How did you know I was going for that?!"

Cameron "You kind of said it out loud. And you're not that fast anyway..."

Larry "Impossible... He must be an esper or something!"

Larry "NEVER!!!"

#(Screen shakes. Cracking sound effect.)

"On all fours and a nearly broken back, Larry comes crawling over to his side of the ring. He hides his face in shame after that humiliating defeat."

Cho "The Pipsqueak became The Cockroach! A worthy title indeed!"

Diana "What were ya sayin' earlier? Somethin' about me crawlin' back to ya?"

Larry "I'll show you! I'll show you all, dammit..."

#(Cameron appears stoic.)

Cameron "Having spirit is great, Larry, but you need to use your head a little more."

#(Fadehold to the same scene to convey a change of time.)

"After witnessing Larry's defeat, the rest of the team finally started listening to Cameron's coaching and they won the next two rounds convincingly. Aqua advances to the next round with a 4-1 victory."

Larry "I LOVE VANILLA!!!"

Cameron "Everyone, LINE UP!!!"

#(Cho and Larry look serious.)

"The team members shut up and scatter into position like mice. People in the audience were surprised by how disciplined the rowdy team became during Cameron's command."

#(normal)
Cameron "Excellent work out there! That third match was pretty shaky, but we really pulled it together and defeated Karma High."

Larry "Wait. That was their actual name?!"

Cameron "Yes, they are a formidable team known to perform significantly better when their opponent insults them."

Larry "You're kidding, right...?"

Cameron "We have some time before the next match, so go take a break, but don't be late! Is that clear?!"

#(Larry looks serious.)

Everyone "YES, SIR!!!"

#(Hide the characters.)

"After dismissing them, the team split into smaller groups and go their separate ways. Cameron heads towards the bleachers to greet her guests."

#(Cameron, Diana, and May appear.)

Diana "Great job out there, cuz! Ya really whooped them!"

May "Yeah, you were so cool!"

#(nervous smile)
Cameron "Thanks. I appreciate the support, but could you tone down the cheerleading a little?"

Diana "We're just showin' some love. What's wrong with that?"

#(nervous smile)
Cameron "*sigh* Boys will be boys..."

Cameron "WHAT?!"

May "Yeah... I really wanted to tell them you're not like that, but that might ruin your secret."

Cameron "DIANA!"

Cameron "Aahh!!"

#(Robin appears laughing. He's wearing his gym uniform.)

Robin "I guess even you drop your guard sometimes. Sorry I'm late."

Robin "Right? I wasn't expecting Diana to actually dress up for it. She even dragged May along, too."

#(Robin and Cameron's expressions return to normal.)

"As their laughter subsides, they watched the butterflies for a little longer until they flew away."

#(Cameron's expression becomes sad.)

"At the same time, Cameron is well aware that the boy she likes is right beside her; their fingers are mere inches from touching one another. The distance nearly matches the nature of their relationship - so close, yet so far."

Cameron "Hey, Robin..."

#(curious)
Robin "Hm?"

#(normal)
Cameron "Don't jinx it, okay? Losing isn't an option."

#(concerned)
Robin "Are you worried about what Mr. Scowl said?"

Cameron "There's something I wanted to talk about though..."

Robin "What is it?"

Cameron "Well..."

"The atmosphere around them is quiet, yet unsteady. However, the wheels that Cameron were afraid to move are finally turning."

"As Cameron hurries on ahead, Robin follows behind as something catches on to his shirt."

Cameron "I WILL NOT LOSE!!!!"

"Cameron readies herself, but she is barely standing. The other fighter grins as he takes his stance again, convinced that she wouldn't last another blow."

#(off screen)
Referee "BEGIN!"

#(Hide Cameron.)

"The fighter dashes directly towards her, aiming to close out the match with one more attack. Cameron could tell that much just by watching the way he moved, but she waits for him to come closer."

#(realizes)
Cameron "(Now!)"

#(CG illustration of Cameron fighting.)

"With a sudden burst of adrenaline, Cameron slides under his approach and unleashes a barrage of kicks across his body."

"The sight of it is only a mere shadow compared to when she kicks Larry, which is probably due her lack of energy and grudges. Regardless, the audience is in awe."

"The fighter is completely overwhelmed as every part of his body is met with a thrust. Cameron's final kick sends him flying in the air and knocking him out."

"All of the spectators are left speechless by the sudden reversal. Even the referee is so shocked, he nearly forgets to call the match."

#(End battle music.)

Referee "THIS MATCH IS OVER!!! POINT GOES TO AQUA!!! WITH A SCORE OF 4-1, AQUA ADVANCES TO THE THIRD ROUND!!!"

#(Return to scene. Play motivation music. Cho and Larry appear excited.)

Larry "YESSS!!!! WE DID IT!!!"

#(serious)
Cho "Absurd! The Snail's butt got carried twice now!"

#(sad)
Larry "Please don't talk about that..."

#(laughs)
Cho "WITH MINOR CASUALTIES, AQUA HAS CLAIMED THE SECOND ROUND!!!"

#(grins)
Larry "Heheheh. Just a few more of those and Heaven will smile over me!"

#(smirks)
Cho "The Snail will surely die in the upcoming rounds, but Hell is the true destination."

#(shocked)
Larry "Just you watch! I'll win the next one for sure!"

#(Cameron appears with a smile.)

Cameron "Excellent work, team! Let's keep it up!"

#(concerned)
Cho "Captain, how are those injuries?"

#(normal)
Cameron "Don't worry. It's just a few bruises, so I'm fine."

#(grins)
Larry "Heh. I guess even you can have a hard time."

#(serious)
Cho "Silence! The Snail is being disrespectful!"

#(solemn)
Cameron "It's okay, Cho. I struggled this time and even I thought I'd lose. My opponent was quite skilled, but he underestimated me during the last exchange and dropped his guard."

#(solemn)
Cho "Captain..."

#(normal)
Cameron "Regardless of who you are or what you do, there will always be someone above you. Keep that in mind and stay humble."

#(serious)
Everyone "YES, SIR!!"

#(smiles)
Cameron "Good. Now go relax until the next round starts."

#(Hide Cho and Larry. Cameron looks solemn.)

"With that, the team disperses again and someone from the committee comes to clean the ring. At the same time, Cameron's smile fades as her mind is still wrapped up about what happened earlier."

#(Robin appears concerned.)

Robin "Cameron, are you okay?"

#(serious)
Cameron "Robin, where have you been?! I was so worried!"

#(solemn)
Robin "I'm sorry. Something came up, but I rushed here as fast as I could."

#(curious)
Cameron "Where's May?"

#(End motivation music.)

Robin "Don't worry. She's in a classroom."

#(concerned)
Cameron "Did something happen...?"

"Robin doesn't say a word, but he nods."

#EXT. School Courtyard - Morning

#(Brief flashback. Play flowery music. Robin and May are present. Robin looks concerned, while May looks solemn.)

May "Robin, I like you..."

#(surprised)
Robin "..."

#(normal)
May "I've liked you for as long as I can remember. You're just everything I could ask for in a guy, even though you can be a little uptight at times."

#(smiles)
May "We've known each other for a while now, so I was surprised when I found out you're Ciel."

May "I want you to see that I'm not just your best friend's little sister anymore."

#(normal)
Robin "You've grown a lot. You're not the same little girl who relies on others all the time. You've become a very beautiful and independent young woman."

#(surprised)
May "Do you really mean that?"

Robin "Would I lie to you?"

#(giggles)
May "Well, you've been lying to everyone for the past few years. Not exactly a trustworthy person in my book."

#(smiles)
Robin "All right. You got me, but I'm not lying about this. I'm sure any guy would be lucky to have you as a girlfriend."

#(End flowery music. Robin looks sad.)

Robin "However...I'm afraid I cannot return your feelings."

#(Play sad music. May looks shocked.)

May "..."

Robin "I'm happy you feel that way about me, especially when you didn't know that I'm Ciel. You liked the person I am on the inside and that means a lot."

Robin "You're a really nice girl, May. I'm sure that one day, you'll find a much better person than someone like me. I'm sorry."

#(nervous smile)
May "I've been watching you all this time, so I knew it all along. I knew I was never going to be good enough, but I didn't want to accept it..."

Robin "You're a great person, May. You really are."

#(solemn)
May "(If I am, why would you reject me...? Well, I can think of one reason...)"

#(normal)
Robin "I'll treat you to dessert later. Let's just go watch your sister's match, okay?"

May "You go on ahead. I don't think I'm ready yet..."

#(solemn)
Robin "May..."

May "Please...just leave me alone."

#(May leaves.)

"Holding in her tears, May runs towards the trees as fast as she could, trying to find a place where no one would find her."

Robin "May!"

#(Return to scene.)

#INT. Gym - Morning

#(Robin and Cameron both look concerned.)

"Robin finishes giving her the gist of what happened. Despite winning their match, their expressions could easily fool a passerby into believing they were coping with a loss instead."

Cameron "How is she doing now?"

Robin "She's calmed down a bit. Diana and your mom are looking after her, so she'll be fine."

#(solemn)
Cameron "Robin...why did you reject her? She's liked you longer than anybody I know."

#(shocked)
Robin "..."

#(stoic)
Robin "Your goal is right in front of you, so stay focused. Let's go watch some matches and scope out the competition."

Cameron "Yeah..."

#(Robin leaves.)

"As Robin leaves to find some seats, Cameron can't seem to concentrate on the other matches. She reflects over what just happened to May, reminded that her earlier fears could come true."

Cameron "(May put in her best effort, but she failed. Will I share the same fate...? Why do I also feel relieved?)"

Cameron "(Well, I'm sure I already know the answer to that question. I really am an awful sister, aren't I?)"

#(serious)
Cameron "(I promised May that I wouldn't run away anymore. Regardless of the result, I will come at him head on!)"

#(Mr. Scowl appears stoic.)

Scowl "That was quite the close match there, Cameron. Congratulations on advancing to the third round."

#(realizes)
Cameron "Mr. Scowl!"

Scowl "If you're struggling this much early on, the upcoming rounds don't look promising for you. Don't forget our agreement."

#(serious)
Cameron "My team and I will make it to the top, so you don't need to worry about that. As long as you remember your end of the deal either, all is well."

#(grins)
Scowl "Heh. I'm looking forward to your next match."

#(End sad music.)

#INT. Gym - Day

#(Play motivation music.)

"With consecutive scores of 4-1, Cameron's team continued winning each round and earned their spot in the finals. Their opponent is none other than last year's champions - King High."

"Meanwhile, May is returning to the bleachers with Diana and her mom. As soon as the twins saw her, they approached with concern."

#(Kiki, Mimi, May, Diana, and Margaret are present. Kiki and Mimi look worried, while May still looks a bit sad.)

Kiki "May, are you all right? We heard what happened."

Mimi "If you need anything, we'll be here for you."

May "I'm fine now, but thanks. It'll take some time to get over it though."

#(smiles)
Margaret "Awww. You've got some good friends, May! How about we invite them to dinner after this?"

#(nervous smile)
May "(Well, they're only close to me because they like Cameron...)"

#(serious)
Diana "Man, that Four-Eyes should've jumped on ya when he had the chance! I mean, who could resist a cute little cheerleader?"

#(laughs)
Margaret "Is that really why you dressed up today? How adorable."

#(embarrassed)
May "Cut it out, Mom..."

#(laughs)
Kiki "A little more bold than usual, but typical May. Are you two even cheering for Cameron?"

#(smiles)
Diana "We are, but nothin' wrong with killin' two birds with one stone. Right, May?"

#(normal)
May "Yeah. Today is my sister's big day after all."

#(surprised)
Mimi "Sister...?"

#(surprised)
Kiki "Wait. Really?!"

#(shocked)
May "Oops..."

#(Margaret and Diana smile nervously.)

"Flustered after accidentally revealing Cameron's secret, May and the others struggle to come up with a believable lie in time. By then, the twins realize that this information was the truth."

Kiki "If Cameron is your sister, does that mean we had a crush on a girl...?"

#(shrugs)
Diana "Like I said, there's nothin' wrong with swingin' that way. Might as well wave that your flag with pride."

#(serious)
Mimi "We are NOT gay!"

#(confused)
Kiki"Are we...? Well, Cameron is still pretty hot..."

#(shocked)
Mimi "*gasps* What have we become...?"

Margaret "Uh oh. Do we need to comfort you two as well?"

#(laughs)
Diana "Looks like they fell for the 'trap'! Haha! Get it?"

#(Hide the characters.)

"Speechless after what they've discovered, everyone else in the bleachers turn their attention to the remaining two teams. Both sides are currently deciding on what order to choose for their line ups."

#(Cho appears confident.)

"Aqua decides to lead off with Cho, while the opposing team selects a younger fighter who has performed consistently well this tournament. With these picks, both sides appear ready to get the first point on the board."

#(End motivation music.)

#(off screen)
Referee "BEGIN!"

#(Play battle music. Hide Cho.)

"Cho, once again, starts off the match aggressively with a few swings. Normally, his opponents would be looking to avoid his overwhelming pressure, but this fighter blocks it straight on and transitions into a counter."

#(Screen shakes.)

"The other fighter makes full use of Cho's impatience and delivers a merciless flurry of blows through his chest. Despite every blow being quick, they're also effective without any unnecessary motions."

#(off screen, in pain)
Cho "GAAHH!!"

"Cho is used to being the one on the offensive, but that clearly isn't the case here. While the other fighter may be younger, the way he's able capitalize so much off of a single mistake is comparable to that of a master."

Cho "(Little kid is so fast! Aside from the captain, The Dragon has never experienced this much pressure from anyone!)"

#(Screen shakes.)

"After landing over fifty blows, Cho is forced to kneel and catch his breath. The other fighter finishes off with a somersault kick, which lands right under Cho's lower jaw."

"In terms of power and the point of impact, it's ironically quite similar to the Dragon Punch that Cho used to win his first match. However, Cho isn't left airborne due to his superior weight."

"Considering the significant difference in their heights, many people assumed that Cho wouldn't have much trouble against this opponent. However, this spectacle completely changed their opinions."

#(off screen, serious)
Larry "Cho! Hang in there!"

#(off screen, serious)
Cameron "Get up! We're counting on you!"

"Slowly but surely, Cho is back on his two feet. He stands tall and proud, almost trying to bluff that none of those attacks even fazed him."

#(End battle music. Play epic music. Cho appears serious.)

Cho "(The team entrusted The Dragon to get the first win...to ride a momentum towards victory... The Dragon must not fall here to some little monkey!)"

Cho "The Dragon vowed never to lose to anyone again! BLACK DRAGON RISES!!!"

#(Hide Cho.)

"A burst of wind emits from Cho's body, as if he powered up into his final form. His large muscles are standing out more than usual; even his eyebrows look thicker."

"Despite being intimidated by Cho's fearsome aura, his opponent stands on guard while keeping a safe distance. He remains calm until he notices a familiar stance."

"It was the same stance that fighters from video games take to shoot a fireball. People in the bleachers were chuckling, but the look on his eyes are dead serious."

#(off screen, serious)
Cho "Haaaa......"

#(off screen, laughs)
Larry "What are you doing, Cho? Even I know that's not fooling anybody."

"Channeling his energy into the very tips of his fingers, the air around him intensifies and the space between his palms begins to spark a little."

#(shocked)
Larry "SAY WHAT?!"

Cho "HHHHHAAAAAAAA!!!!!"

Larry "EEEKKKK!!! EVERYONE, RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!"

"Everyone, who was laughing at him before, begins to panic. Even his opponent had no idea what was going on, but he's more frightened than anybody since he's the one in the ring."

"The second he takes a step back, Cho tightens his fist."

#(Cho appears serious.)

Cho "Black Dragon.....PUUUUNNNNCH!!!!"

#(Hide Cho. Screen shakes.)

"After rushing in as fast as he could, Cho returns the favor by sending him flying with his own uppercut. Other than adding the word 'Black' to it, this punch looks about the same as the normal Dragon Punch."

"The referee hurries over to the other side and finds the fighter unconscious."

#(End epic music.)

Referee "THIS MATCH IS OVER! POINT GOES TO AQUA!!!"

#(Return to scene. Play motivation music.)

"The audience cheers as the home team is the first to put a point on the board. As a proud representative of his school, Cho raises his fist once more."

#(Cho is present with a smirk.)

Cho "Good. The Dragon is getting stronger."

#(Diana appears with a smile.)

Diana "That was awesome! One down and three more to go!"

#(smiles)
Cho "Indeed! And Redhead will soon be our prize!"

#(realizes)
Diana "(Oh wait. They might actually win at this rate...)"

#(Diana leaves.)

"Diana leaves the gym for a second to go pray, while Larry rushes over to Cho's side."

#(Larry appears shocked.)

Larry "Cho! How did you do that?!"

#(curious)
Cho "Do what?"

Larry "You went all Super Cho and scared the heck out of me!"

#(serious)
Cho "Black Dragon."

#(nervous smile)
Larry "Right. Black Dragon..."

Cho "The Dragon can only become The Black Dragon during a pinch. As Pipsqueak can see, it is very dangerous, so it should not be used lightly."

#(amazed)
Larry "That's so cool! How can I do that?!"

#(normal)
Cho "Simple! You must connect with your inner beasts and become one!"

#(realizes)
Larry "*gasps* I understand now! All this time...you were never making fun of me. You were showing me the path to becoming a true fighter!"

#(sad)
Larry "I'm sorry, Cho! You were just trying to help, but I was so blind!"

#(smiles)
Cho "The Dragon forgives you! Now, remember your beasts!"

#(excited)
Larry "I am The Cockroach! I am The Snail!"

#(laughs)
Cho "That's the spirit! Now go learn all you can about them and use that in the match!"

#(smiles)
Larry "Thanks, Cho!"

#(Larry leaves, while Cho's expression returns to normal.)

"Cho proudly watches over his student as Larry hurries outside to train his mind."

#(Cameron appears curious.)

Cameron "Where did Larry run off to?"

Cho "He is searching for himself, but worry not. He will return in time for his match."

#(normal)
Cameron "Anyway, excellent work out there. You were great, Cho."

#(smiles)
Cho "Thank you, Captain! The Dragon has done all he can for the team!"

#(smiles)
Cameron "Yep. Leave the rest to us."

#(Cut to the same scene to convey some time passed by.)

"Despite Cho winning the first match, Aqua wasn't able to ride the momentum as much as they hoped. After a few more matches finished, Aqua is now behind 1-2."

"Both sides, however, seem evenly matched since every round so far came down to the wire. This next match is particularly important, as it could either tie the score or set up for match point."

#(Robin and Cameron appear serious.)

Robin "They're strong..."

Cameron "They are last year's champions after all. I expect no less from such a worthy adversary."

#(curious)
Robin "Who's next again?"

#(nervous smile)
Cameron "Larry..."

#(off screen)
Referee "Both competitors, please step forward!"

"The representative from the other team steps into the ring. He seems about as tall and intimidating as Larry's previous opponents."

"Everyone is now waiting on Aqua to send in their fighter, but their tardiness has people mumbling and worried."

#(serious)
Cameron "He's late! Where is he?!"

#(concerned)
Cho "The Dragon does not have the answer to that question."

Cameron "Find him! If he ran away at a time like this, I'll make him wish he was dead!"

Referee "If Aqua doesn't send in their selected member, they will lose this round!"

#(realizes)
Cameron "We don't have enough time..."

#(End motivation music. Hide the characters.)

"Suddenly, the doors swing open as the ray of light nearly blinding those who looked their way. Everyone got quiet and all they could see is a figure's silhouette."

Larry "Sorry to keep you waiting, but I have returned!"

#(Screen shakes. Punching sound effect. Hide Larry.)

Robin "(Ouch...)"

Cameron "Any last words?"

Larry "You still need me to compete, right...?"

#(nervous smile)
Cameron "Oh yeah..."

Robin "(Heh. Even Cameron can be a little reckless sometimes.)"

Referee "So...are you ready now?"

Larry "Bring it on!"

#(End epic music.)

Referee "BEGIN!"

#(Play battle music. Hide Larry.)

"Larry, who seems more confident than ever, takes his stance before signaling his opponent to come at him. The other fighter stays on guard, but decides to make the approach."

#(Larry appears shocked.)

Larry "COCKROACH STANCE!!!"

"Larry's sudden cry catches his opponent off guard as he lays his body over the mat. The other fighter seems baffled by what he was witnessing."

Larry "Heh. You've fallen right into my trap! The moment someone sees a cockroach, they freeze up with fear!"

Larry "What do you think of my-?"

Larry "BLACK COCKROACH RISES!!!"

#(off screen, shocked)
Cho "It...can't be. Has he perfected it?!"

#(Hide Larry.)

"A burst of wind emits from Larry's body, as if he's powered up into his final form. However, it doesn't look nearly as intimidating as Cho's and the other fighter even raises an eyebrow."

Larry "Heh. Are you scared yet?"

#(Screen shakes. Cracking sound effect.)

#(off screen, shocked)
Larry "GAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!"

"Without a care of what Larry was planning, his opponent keeps stomping him over and over again."

Larry "WAIT! LEMME USE MY FINAL FORM, DAMMIT!!!"

Robin "(I don't think he's risen yet...)"

#(Screen shakes. Cracking sound effect.)

"His opponent stomps on him once more before kicking him over."

Larry "Blegh..."

#(curious)
Robin "(Is it over..?)"

#(serious)
Larry "The Black Cockroach may have failed, but I'm not done yet..."

Cho "Could it be...?"

#(Larry is smirking.)

"Larry remains grounded, but he rolls his legs back as far as he could to resemble a snail's shell. Everyone, except Cho, looks confused about what he was doing."

Larry "THAT'S RIGHT! THIS...IS THE SNAIL STANCE!!!"

"His opponent simply walks over and performs a boston crab lock, almost as if Larry wanted him to do it."

#(Screen shakes. Cracking sound effect.)

#(off screen, shocked)
Larry "GAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!"

#(off screen, serious)
Cameron "Don't give up, Larry! This match is really important!"

Larry "AARRRGGHHHH!!!"

#(Screen shakes.)

"After enduring for as long as he could, Larry reluctantly taps out. This match ended up feeling like a repeat of the first two rounds."

Larry "UNCLE!!!! UNCLE!!!!"

#(End epic music.)

Referee "THIS MATCH IS OVER!!! POINT GOES TO EXTERMINATOR!!!"

Larry "Hold on! Exterminator? You're pulling my leg this time!"

#(Play motivation music.)

"Larry comes crawling back all the same, but no one is laughing this time. With this loss, the opposing team is one fight away from winning the tournament."

#(Cameron and Larry are present. Cameron looks serious, while Larry smiles nervously.)

Larry "That...didn't turn out too well."

Cameron "Your fighting style is pretty abnormal, but at least you tried your best."

#(sad)
Larry "Sorry, Captain..."

#(Cho appears serious.)

Cho "Captain! The guy who was supposed to go next is too injured from the last round! We need a sub!"

#(shocked)
Cameron "What?! We're down 1-3! It's already their match point!"

#(Robin appears serious.)

Robin "I'll go."

#(serious)
Cameron "Don't be stupid! These guys are really strong - they're last year's champions!"

#(normal)
Robin "I may not have much experience, but I've been watching most of their matches. You'll never know unless you try, right?"

#(concerned)
Cameron "I’m happy that you're trying to support us, but I never wanted you to actually fight! You'll get hurt if you go out there!"

Cho "Captain, no other subs available, so there isn't much of a choice. Please let Puny Nerd fight."

Cameron "All right. Just be careful, okay...?"

#(serious)
Robin "I will."

#(Hide all characters.)

"Once they've made their decision, Robin heads to the right; it's a sight that surprises everyone, including Mr. Scowl."

#(Robin and Mr. Scowl are present. Robin looks stoic, while Mr. Scowl looks shocked.)

Scowl "What...is the meaning of this?"

Robin "Exactly what it looks like. I'm subbing in for this round."

#(stoic)
Scowl "Seems like your team has given up. What a shame. This is probably one of the most disappointing finals I've ever witnessed."

Robin "Isn't it a bit early for you to say that? Cameron's match is next, so make sure you watch it."

Scowl "Because of this little stunt, I won't even get the chance. How disappointing."

#(Mr. Scowl leaves.)

"As Robin steps into the ring, all he could see is his opponent's grin."

Robin "(I'm being underestimated, but I don't blame him. If I was watching this from the sidelines, I'd probably bet on that guy.)"

Robin "(Oh well. There's no use thinking about it now."

Referee "BEGIN!!!"

#(End motivation music. Play battle music. CG illustration of Robin fighting.)

"Robin makes sure to keep a safe distance at all times, but his opponent isn't giving him much space. Through footwork alone, the other fighter is already doing a fantastic job pressuring him towards the corner."

"Realizing this, Robin begins the offense and doesn't hold back. He throws a few punches, without the intent to land their mark, but to put himself in a better position."

Robin "(I can't afford to let him push me back. That's how he's been getting all of his wins up until now.)"

#(Kicking sound effect. Robin looks shocked.)

"However, in response to his next whiff, the opponent answers with a brutal roundhouse kick through Robin's torso, followed by a left hook across his face."

Robin "UGGHHH!!!"

"Robin falls to his knees before the other fighter pushes him down on his back. He mounts him and starts punching his face one after another."

"The opponent is pounding away as he pleases, and he even starts drawing blood. It doesn't take long before Robin ceases to struggle."

#(off screen, shocked)
Cameron "ROBIN!!!!"

"Cameron looks devastated as she continues to watch helplessly. Her face is buried in her palms so no one could see her cry, yet she's still trembling."

"The boy she loves is getting injured as a price for her own ambitions, and she finds herself town between the two."

"However, the moment Robin catches a glimpse of her worried, he lands a fist through the gut and pushes him over."

Robin "(For Cameron's sake, I can't afford to lose! She's counting on me!!!)"

"The underdog slowly gets back up on his feet and wipes the blood off of his lips. He's breathing heavily, but at least he managed to create some space."

#(serious)
Robin "*pant* *pant* I'm...not done yet!"

"As his opponent makes another approach, Robin ducks under the attack and spears through him on the turn. Blazing with passion unlike ever before, Robin lands fist after fist with everything he's got."

Robin "HHHAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!"

"Robin yells as he pushes forward with every blow he connects, and he's getting faster. They're not particularly strong hits on their own, but the damage continues to stack."

"With one final punch through the solar plexus, Robin manages to knock his opponent out of the ring. The referee hurries over to check on his opponent."

#(End battle music.)

Robin "(*pant* *pant* Did I do it...?)"

Referee "THIS MATCH IS OVER!!! POINT GOES TO AQUA!!!"

#(Play quality time music. Robin looks surprised.)

"The gym erupts as the upset is announced, and Robin couldn't believe his ears. The team is even cheering in celebration, almost as if they'd won the whole thing."

#(CG illustration of Cameron looking worried, while Robin is resting in her arms.)

"But after taking a few steps out of the ring, Robin's exhausted body finally collapses in Cameron's arms."

Cameron "Robin!"

Robin "It's okay. I'm just...a little tired. Do you mind...if I rest here for a bit?"

#(teary smile)
Cameron "Not at all. Take as much time as you need."

Robin "Sorry..."

Cameron "Thank you for being so brave. You were amazing out there. Because of you, we still have a chance to take this."

Robin "Seeing you cry made me realize how bad I was getting my butt handed to me. I had to do something about it."

#(embarrassed)
Cameron "I wasn't crying... I just...had something in my eyes."

Robin "You know, I think it's really cool how you're trying to send a message and help other people. No matter what the outcome may be, I'm sure you'll reach them."

Robin "After all, you've already changed my life."

#(teary smile)
Cameron "Yeah..."

Robin "Now, go out there and answer everyone's expectations. I know you can do it."

Cameron "I will."

#(Return to scene. Cameron looks serious.)

Cameron "(The score is 2-3, so I'm our last line of defense! If we want to bring this to the final round, I have to concentrate!)"

"Remaining poised and focused, Cameron steps forward to meet a much larger opponent. But, to her surprise, she recognizes him."

#(grins)
Cameron "(I'm going up against their team captain? Hmph! I couldn't ask for a more fitting opponent.)"

#(End quality time music.)

"The other fighter seems to be just as satisfied as she is. The two competitors respectfully bow to each other before taking their stances."

#(off screen)
Referee "BEGIN!"

#(Play battle music. Hide Cameron.)

"Loud cheers for both sides roar as the fighters begin to move, yet neither combatant is too hasty to make any sudden attacks."

"They're patiently keeping track of each other's movement habits by observing their footwork. They're even faking moves to see if they could provoke a reaction."

"On the surface, not much seems to be happening, but they're actually imagining various scenarios of the match. It's almost like watching wise generals plan out their strategies before engaging in actual combat."

#(CG illustration of Cameron fighting.)

Cameron "HYAAHHHHH!!!!!"

"As soon as Cameron finds a small opening, she doesn't hesitate to throw a swift roundhouse kick. The other captain, however, keeps his guard up and blocks her attack."

#(serious)
Cameron "(His reaction is good, but I can adapt.)"

"Cameron quickly switches to a fierce punch towards his left, but he blocks that as well. With her arm and leg up in the air, she finds herself in a vulnerable position."

"However, with both blocks up, her opponent cannot immediately switch to offense either, so he uses his upper body to push her back instead. By doing so, the situation is reset back to neutral."

"Despite their differences in physical builds, both sides seem about evenly matched in terms of speed and power. However, Cameron is at a mental disadvantage since the other side still has a match to spare."

"The other fighter knows this, so he decides to take a few more risks by going in. By doing so, he intends to apply more pressure and bait out an error from her."

#(Return to scene.)

"Before long, Cameron finally caves in and whiffs a left jab, only for her opponent to capitalize on the opportunity. Once he gets a hold of her arm, he swings Cameron over his shoulder and slams her down."

#(Screen shakes. Cameron is struggling.)

Cameron "Argh!!!"

#(off screen, shocked)
Robin "CAMERON!!!"

"Her opponent attempts to throw a punch while she's still vulnerable, but Cameron manages to roll away. As she hurries back on her feet, she tries to bluff her back injury."

"However, she couldn't hide it. The pain is too much for her."

#(Screen shakes.)

"As the other captain confronts her again with a right hook, Cameron blocks it in time, but she's immediately caught by his left."

Cameron "Ugh!!!"

"Cameron falls to her knees and kneels over, grieving in agony. This sight alone is enough to convince most people that the match is near its conclusion."

May "It's not over! You can do it!"

"The other fighter walks back to his side of the ring, assured that the match is over. He didn't even need to hear the referee make the call."

#(serious)
Cameron "Wait..."

#(CG illustration of Cameron fighting.)

"The second he turns around, his jaw is met with a quick uppercut, followed by a stepping 360 degree spinning back kick through his chest."

"Her opponent's body slides back from the impact, but he's still standing. However, he seems more shocked that he was actually pushed back, almost as if no one's ever done that to him before."

Cameron "I'm not done yet!"

"Cameron quickly dashes in to keep her momentum going; the other captain keeps his guard up. Unshaken by her determined spirit, he waits patiently for her to get in range."

"The second she comes close enough, he throws a few rapid jabs. However, she evades each of them in time and counters with her own."

"Like water, her body smoothly maneuvers around before continuing her onslaught of attacks. Each kick fluidly connects and smashes away at the other fighter's ribs."

#(off screen, surprised)
May "She's so fast..."

#(off screen, excited)
Diana "There ya go, Cam! Knock him out!!!"

"Cameron's body is moving faster than she could imagine, and every hit brings her one step closer to victory. Even someone of his stature would fall from taking an overwhelming series of strikes."

Cameron "(Almost there! I'll make this comeback and bring our team to the final round!)"

#(Screen shakes. Cameron looks shocked.)

Cameron "Guhh..."

#(Return to scene.)

"Everyone seems confused as they notice Cameron freeze up. Apparently, her opponent landed one more solid strike to her back, causing her to crumble in place."

#(off screen, hurt)
Cameron "(No, I can't lose here... Not when I'm so close...)"

#(Screen shakes. CG illustration of Cameron struggling.)

"Finally free from her pressure, her opponent immediately lands several jabs through her gut."

"Cameron, on the other hand, is still stunned that he was able to counter-attack during her assault. But now, she's just trying to stay in the match and endure."

Cameron "Argh..."

"Cameron is breathing heavily, and she's desperately trying to gather enough strength to stand. If she relaxes for even a second, her body would collapse."

Cameron "(This tournament means too much for me to give up here! Everyone is watching me! And my team is depending on me!)"

Cameron "(I still have something to prove!)"

"She manages to scrape up whatever remaining energy she had left - just enough to put her guard up. Her glare serves as a warning not to pity her."

#(serious)
Cameron "HERE I COME!!!"

"With nothing but respect, the other captain grins, acknowledging her commitment to their well-fought battle. The only way to honor her bravery is to hold nothing back until the very end."

#(End battle music. Screen fades to black.)

Cameron "Mm..."

"Exhausted yet comfortable, Cameron's injured body rests soundly. Rays of the setting sun just catch her eyelids, and she slowly opens them."

#(CG illustration of Cameron in bed, while Robin is seated in a chair beside her. She seems confused, while Robin is asleep. Play sad music.)

"Cameron's vision soon stabilizes and she recognizes that she's in the clinic. She turns to see Robin resting patiently by her side; it appears he's been watching her for some time now."

Cameron "Robin...?"

#(Robin wakes up. He looks concerned.)

Robin "O-Oh, sorry. I fell asleep. Should I close the blinds?"

Cameron "Wait... What am I doing here?"

"Robin frowns as he realizes that he's the one who has to break the news to her."

Robin "You got knocked out, so we brought you here after the match."

#(shocked)
Cameron "I lost...?"

#(sad)
Cameron "Our chance to win was standing right in front of me, but I blew it. Everyone was counting on me and I let them down."

Cameron "I'm sorry you had to see me like that, Robin. After everything you did for me..."

#(normal)
Robin "Cameron, you were great out there and you've got nothing to apologize for. In fact, you actually didn't let anyone down."

#(shocked)
Cameron "What?! What do you mean?!"

Robin "It was a double knockout. Even though you didn't get the point, you kept the team in the game and gave us another chance."

Cameron "How did we do?!"

#(sad)
Robin "Unfortunately, we lost the next match and ended up with second place. It was really close though."

#(shocked)
Cameron "I see... We failed..."

#(solemn)
Cameron "We trained so hard for this day, so I was confident that we could take it. If I won my match to tie it up, that could have helped maintain the team's morale..."

#(normal)
Robin "Don't beat yourself up about it. If anyone else went up against him, it would have been a loss for sure."

Cameron "Thanks. But it hurts to be so close, yet so far..."

Robin "Lots of teams competed today, right? I'm sure they trained ridiculously hard, so you should be proud that we made it this far."

Robin "Even if you're disappointed in yourself right now, just know that at least I'm happy for you."

#(giggles)
Cameron "Thanks for staying with me, Robin. I feel a little better now."

#(curious)
Cameron "Where's everyone else?"

#(normal)
Robin "They're all in the hall waiting for you."

#(End sad music.)

"Robin walks towards the door, filled with many worried faces trying to peek inside. Eventually, he opens it and lets them in."

#(Play quality time music. CG illustration of Robin, Elisabeth, Anya, Diana, May, Kiki, Mimi, Cho, Larry, and Margaret surrounding Cameron's bed. Cameron is in tears.)

"Slowly but surely, everyone starts filling up the room and surrounds Cameron with smiles. To her surprise, not a single one of them looks disappointed."

"But even then, Cameron feels the responsibility, as the captain, to reflect on the outcome."

Cameron "I'm sorry, everyone. You all took time out of your busy schedules just to see us fall short. We tried our best to take home the gold tonight, but it wasn't enough..."

Margaret "Cameron, I will always make time for you! And you were really great out there! I'm so proud of you!"

Elisabeth "Yes! I was thoroughly entertained by your performance! You represented our school extraordinarily well!"

Kiki "Silver is shiny, too! That's still a huge accomplishment!"

#(sad)
Larry "Gold is better though..."

#(serious)
Mimi "Zip it, you jerk!"

Diana "Ya put up a good fight, cuz! I wanna see that chin up, so don't apologize!"

Cho "The Dragon is still lost for words that the captain is actually a girl."

#(surprised)
Cameron "Wait. How did you know?"

#(nervous smile)
May "Sorry. I kind of let it slip...again."

#(laughs)
Cameron "I should've known. You really were never good at keeping secrets."

#(shocked)
Larry "Wait! You were a girl this whole time?! How many times did you kick my butt again?!"

Cameron "I lost count."

#(smiles)
Robin "See? No one is disappointed in you."

#(smiles)
Cameron "You're right. Thank you all for coming out today! Whether you were competing with me or watching on the side, I truly appreciate your support."

#(soft smile)
Cameron "I just wanted to show everyone that girls can compete, too..."

#(Mr. Scowl appears with a normal expression.)

Scowl "And that is exactly what you did."

#(surprised)
Cameron "Mr. Scowl?!"

Scowl "Cameron, I owe you an apology. I never thought I'd meet anyone who could stand up to the captain of King High."

Scowl "He's been undefeated for over a year, and even though it wasn't a win, you managed to score a double knockout against him. That alone was enough to change my opinion and admit I was wrong."

Cameron "But...we lost. Aren't you going to punish me for lying?"

Scowl "I can't do that, especially not after watching that fight. Of course, I can't allow you to hide your gender anymore, but you'll always be welcome to compete."

Scowl "I look forward to seeing you soon."

#(smiles)
Cameron "Thank you!"

#INT. Canal - Evening

"After that weekend, it became public knowledge that Cameron is in fact a girl. News of her accomplishment spreaded everywhere: Teenage Girl Leads a Boys' Martial Arts Team to the Finals."

"People were concerned about whether their trophy would be confiscated or not. But, despite the controversy, the organizers ultimately decided not to punisher her."

"In fact, so many new doors opened for her instead. The committee actually invited her to interviews and asked her questions about what it was like to compete with the boys."

"Several colleges are even offering her scholarships once she graduates high school. With everything that's been happening lately, it's become clear that Cameron has a bright future ahead of her."

"Today, Robin and Cameron are returning from an after school celebration for a successful season. They're relaxing along the bridge as they watch the clouds drift above them."

#(Robin appears.)

Robin "The clouds look nice today, don't they?"

#(CG illustration of Cameron wearing the female school uniform.)

Cameron "Yeah, they do..."

Robin "You've gotten quite popular lately, especially with all the news that's been buzzing around. You even inspired May and a bunch of your fans to start a girls' martial arts team."

Cameron "It's not exactly what I had in mind, but I'm glad May took something away from it. Maybe I reached my goal after all."

#(giggles)
Cameron "Of course, I would've been happier if we got the gold though."

#(normal)
Robin "It doesn't matter what rank you got. You'll always be number one in my book."

#(surprised)
Cameron "..."

#(chuckles)
Robin "Sorry. Did I catch you off guard?"

#(embarrassed)
Cameron "I-I was wondering if you wanted to hang out sometime. We could play in the arcades again or go grab some dessert somewhere."

Cameron "You know...whenever you're free."

#(Robin offers his hand and smiles.)

Robin "How about now?"

#(Cameron looks surprised.)

"Cameron is taken back by his answer, and it takes her some time to register what he just said. She hesitates to respond."

#(Robin and Cameron hold hands. They're both smiling.)

"After their fingers touch, Cameron's face lights up with joy when they're finally holding each other's hand."

Cameron "Does this mean we're a little closer than being friends now...?"

Robin "Much closer."

"With their fingers intertwined, Cameron rests her head over Robin's shoulder as they watch the wonderful sunset together."

#(Roll the credits. Cameron's route completed.)
