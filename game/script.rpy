"Long ago, a devastating drought ravaged the land."

"Their soil was too parched to grow crops and their livestock dwindled in number. Heat strokes, hunger, and dehydration took the lives of countless villagers."

"Without the necessary resources for survival, the villagers turned to Levios, the sea deity, and prayed for food and clean water."

"Levios granted them their wish, but only under one condition - that the merfolk would be allowed to live peacefully among them. And for many decades, they did."

"Over time, however, the merfolk were gradually discriminated against because they were considered abnormal half-humans - inferior beings."

"Levios became enraged and created an underwater kingdom, now known as Ancient Aquadine, to personally lead and protect the merfolk himself..."

"Until one day, the ancient civilization ceased to exist."
